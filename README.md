Kovot stream for Mastodon

## What is this?
The `kovotext` package provides a Kovot stream for connecting a chatbot made by Kovot to Mastodon.
Kovot is a great framework, which is made by @kenkov, for implementing a chatbot easily, rapidly, and flexibility!
The original `kovot` package contains a Kovot stream implementation for connecting with Mastodon.
Of course, some functions provided in the `kovotext` package are merged into the `kovot` package.
However, the `kovotext` package additionally provides modern, extensive, experimental features.

## Acknowledgements
We greatly thank @kenkov for developing the original Kovot implementation and giving us valuable information about Kovot development.
